###
GAME LOGIC

Mostly done how to handle incoming clicks, still need to work out Reset.

Completed 


###
ACCOUNTS

Should be able to handle account creation and sign-in on single page.
Check in regarding potential sign in at same time as account create


###
FIRST PAGE LOAD

Still unsure of what view state to display to users when they first load site
Potentially have New Game centered in screen. Clicking should check for accounts
being signed in, load sign-in/create view if not, if so, load game view

###
GAMEBOARD

Still thinking of open grid vs fully closed. Can use border to define inner divs
